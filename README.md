# Part-of-speech Tagging :bookmark_tabs:

In this work we have tried four diﬀerent models to address the “Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging” task.
Starting from a baseline we have applied diﬀerent strategies to improve the performances of our archi-
tectures. To determine the best models we have tried to vary the diﬀerent hyperparameters of models
so that, through a comparison on the F1-metric, we have been able to select the two most promising
models: one based on a bidirectional GRU layer, the other on a two-layers bidirectional LSTM. On
them we have performed the evaluation on the test set and the error analysis.
